    <h3>This little guy on the right is Kenny when he was little. 
      I love this photo because it shows his personality.</h3>
    <h3>My son and I have collaborated on several different logos,
      he is the artist following guidelines for each project,
      he is the true talent here but I am very proud of the
      collaboration and wanted to show the logos he has
      helped me with, we work as a collaboration team on
      all of my projects where I need artistic talent and
      inspiration. He is the best.. The skiing Alien was for an
      Air Force Software Development Team where I worked for
      three years. He created the logo shown below with three
      different options. The G is a new logo created for a water
      feature small business and the NG Pizza logo was created
      for a school assignment representing our small restaurant
      business that we owned for many years. The restaurant
      logo was created by my husband, Jeff Gabor -
      the three little men - and was the
      inspiration for the NG Pizza logo.</h3>
