    <h3>This is one of the first websites I ever created. It was based on an idea to request tutorials from a professional chef.
      The idea was that you could send in a request to have the chef create a tutorial for a dish you would like to learn how to make
      and then you could upload a video of yourself making the same dish using the guidelines from the tutorial or blog post. This
      was meant to be a home base for a community that loves to cook and watch others cooking.</h3>
      
    <h3>To create it I used mainly simple html and css. It is a humble beginning, it has a couple of forms and links to vendors we cared 
      about. We never pursued it but the idea was to request these vendors to sponsor the blog.</h3>

    <h3>I started with this palette because these were the colors that we had for the restaurant we used to own, the chef on the
      website was the owner/creator of the Gabor Brothers Restaurant. We wanted a way to use his name to create a following for
      the blog.</h3>

    <h3>I created a prototype using powerpoint because it was my first attempt at prototyping, but I fell in love with
      with the idea of creating a prototype at the beginning of the project. It helped to put everything on paper and
      see what it could look like. It is my favorite part of building websites, or any large complex project.
