        <p>Many of the design concepts I care about are based on experiences gained from owning our own small restaurant
        for 15 years. As a business our focus was on creating an excellent product and providing a memorable user
        experience for our guests.
        There were many aspects of our business that peaked my interest in UX and UI, and the importance
        of data for reporting and decision making. We used a POS (Point of Sale) system to track the
        goods that sold the most and used the data to make decisions on our menu. We also depended
        on our website and reviews to bring in new business. These observations started my journey to
        a formal education in User Experience and Design.
        For the last three years I have been studying the principles of User Experience and Design at
        Weber State University in Ogden Utah and received a certification in User Experience and
        Design in August of 2022 and am a few semesters away from my Degree as a Full Stack
        User Experience Design Developer.
        I have a big family and we enjoy getting together for a family meal every holiday and birthday.
        We love our little wiener dogs. For many years my husband and I worked on every holiday
        at our restaurant, but now we are able to cook together at home every night, and the meals are
        spectacular sometimes. (My husband is an excellent chef!) My favorite things to do are listening
        to old records and cooking with my family. I also enjoy Pilates and sew whenever I can.</p>
