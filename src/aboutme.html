      <h2>Hello!</h2>

        <p>Many of the design concepts I care about are based on experiences gained from owning our own small restaurant
        for 15 years. There were many aspects of our business that peaked my interest in UX and UI, and the importance
        of data for reporting and decision making. We used a POS (Point of Sale) system to track the
        goods that sold the most and used the data to make decisions on our menu. We also depended
        on our website and reviews to bring in new business. These observations started my journey to
        a formal education in User Experience and Design.</p>

        <p>For the last three years I have been studying the principles of User Experience and Design at
        Weber State University in Ogden Utah and received a certification for this in August of 2022, I am 
        a semester away from my Degree in User Experience and Design.</p>

        <p>I have a big family and we enjoy getting together for a family meal every holiday and birthday.
        We love our little wiener dogs. For many years my husband and I worked on every holiday
        at our restaurant, but now we are able to cook together at home every night, and the meals are
        spectacular. My favorite things to do are listening to old records and cooking with my family. 
        I also enjoy Pilates and sew whenever I can.</p>

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>AI is a useful tool and can help create things faster, or help you when you get stuck. The mechanics of web pages or aps may be able to be completed quickly and efficiently with AI but tackling the right problems and getting to the heart of what can be done to improve things will still need to investigated by humans.</p>
